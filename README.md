# Binary-search
Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from an ordered list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item, until you've narrowed down the possible locations to just one.


A binary heap is a complete binary tree which satisfies the heap ordering property. The ordering can be one of two types: the min-heap property: the value of each node is greater than or equal to the value of its parent, with the minimum-value element at the root.
